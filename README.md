Questions about this project:
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The Chada Tech Item Tracking project aimed to efficiently manage and analyze item frequencies read from an input file (CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt). 
- What did you do particularly well?
   The project excelled in several areas, notably in the efficient management of data using the unordered_map for rapid lookups and updates. 
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   To further improve the code, considerations could be made in enhancing input validation to handle edge cases more robustly. Implementing exception handling for file operations could increase the program's reliability.
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The most challenging aspect was designing the histogram generation function to visually represent item frequencies. Researching best practices for formatting and aligning text output in C++ was crucia
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-  Skills developed in this project, such as data structure selection (unordered_map), menu-driven interface design, and error handling strategies, are highly transferable.
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-  To ensure maintainability, the program was structured with clear, descriptive variable names and function definitions. Modularizing functionality and adhering to coding conventions improved readability!
